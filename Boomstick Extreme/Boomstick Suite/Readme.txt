Hey dudes! I made this little app to make life easier for us.

the final version will have:
- Resource Editor
- Level Editor
- Boot the game up from the suite

At the moment it has:
- Resource Editor
- Level Editor
- Open photoshop/paint to edit images
- Boot the game up from the suite

Anyway, to use it, simply start the exe, click Preferences in the menu and select 
your boomstick working directory. 

Have fun, y'all
